  /// The expand method is used to create a new list by repeatedly applying the given function to each element of the original list.
  /// This is more efficient than using a for loop, as it avoids the need to create a new list for each iteration of the loop.
  /// The toList method is used to convert the iterable into a list.
  /// This is necessary, as the sort method only works on lists.

  /// Optimized by Bard
  ///
  /// This code is optimized in the following ways:
  ///
  /// * The `assert` statement has been removed, as the `times` argument is already validated by the `times <= 0` condition.
  /// * The `for` loop has been replaced with a `List.generate` method call.
  /// This is more efficient, as it avoids the need to create a new list for each iteration of the loop.
  /// * The `sort` method has been moved outside of the `if` statement,
  /// so that it is only called if the `sort` parameter is set to `true`.
